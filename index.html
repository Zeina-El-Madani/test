                        <h4>Project Summary</h4>
                        <p>My project is a short film commenting on censorship and the lack of freedom of speech of antigenocide students and Palestinians in American universities and highlights the impact genocide has on Palestinian land and its people. It uses the destruction of a pomegranate as a metaphor to the censorship of Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters. This was instigated by a course I took at the University of Rochester called DMS 103: Essential Digital Media Toolkit. I was able to create a metaphoric video that is 1-2mins long using a C90 camera.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="sumud-detail-section">
                        <h4>My Role and Duration</h4>
                        <p>I was responsible for all elements of creation, from preproduction to post-production, including storyboards, narrative, filming and editing. I casted a Palestinian student studying at University of Rochester because it was important to me that they are from the region to express how they were affected. I wanted to let the Palestinian student have the space to represent their feelings, so I didn't give many directions on what they should do and how they should react and feel. Instead, I would let them know what angle I am shooting from and show them how the shot is set up and then they had the freedom to do what they want. Then I edited the work using Adobe Premiere Pro for the final submission.</p>

                    <div class="sumud-detail-section">
                        <h4>Creative Problem</h4>
                        <p>This was instigated by how American news media was representing the genocide in Palestine, the reaction of the public, and, most importantly, the reaction of universities in the US towards the student protests against war and genocide. I wanted to replicate how Palestinians and students on campus who stand against the genocide felt when their university stood in the way of their freedom of expression, often attacking the students and villainizing them. The video also acts as a metaphoric exploration of the oppression on Palestinians and how traumatizing and unjust the genocide and the colonization of Palestine is.</p>

                    <div class="sumud-detail-section">
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <p>My goal was to make people understand how it feels to be oppressed and neglected in the face of injustice and censorship. It is not only meant to make people sympathize and understand but also push people to fight for what is right, for justice and peace, against entities that choose profit, reputation, and business over a humanitarian crisis.</p>

                    <div class="sumud-detail-section">
                        <h4>Design Process</h4>
                        <p>I knew I wanted to make the project about Palestine, but I didn't know how I should approach it. Initially I was going to make the video about the war itself and what has happened so far. However, there was two issues: one being that the assignment required us to take our own footage, and another one was that it was difficult to find footage of the war that is not copyrighted. So, I decided to center my focus and tackle how the school was dealing with protests and activists on campus. The plan was to interview people who were involved in the activism and highlight how they felt about the school reacting badly. What became a pivotal moment was the political state of the country as Trump had won the elections and immigration was being affected. That was when I started getting scared as I am an international student and being involved in this cause meant trouble with visa status. Cases of immigration problems started coming out, even some being distant friends of mine. I realized that this is basically censorship as I felt unstable and unsafe to express my opinion in a country where freedom of speech is part of the constitution. The project then became about censorship as I found a way to represent Palestine using a pomegranate and oppression by having the pomegranate be destroyed.</p>

                    <div class="sumud-detail-section">
                        <h4>Final Work and Results</h4>
                        <p>The result was a 1-2 min silent, black and white video of a pomegranate being destroyed. People were able to understand what the topic was without the use of dialogue through the sequencing of the video. People thought it was a strong and direct message that made them feel suffocated and frustrated. It also made them reflect on the current events and politics, allowing them to see the other perspective that is silenced by the media by posing a question.</p>
